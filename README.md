## AI Detection Model: Differentiating Synthetic and Real Images

### Overview
This project involves the development of an advanced AI detection model designed to distinguish between synthetic and real images. By leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN), we have created a robust and efficient system capable of high-accuracy image classification.

### Key Features
- **Engineered AI Detection Model:** Utilizes state-of-the-art GAN and RCNN architectures to effectively differentiate between synthetic and real images.
- **Optimized Data Processing:** Achieved a significant reduction in dataset processing time, improving from 2 hours to just 10 milliseconds. This optimization greatly enhances the operational efficiency and responsiveness of the model.
